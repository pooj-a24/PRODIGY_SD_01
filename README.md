The Temperature Conversion Program is a simple Python script designed to convert temperature values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. This tool is useful for anyone who needs to quickly and accurately switch between these common units of temperature measurement.

The program is interactive and user-friendly, prompting the user to input a temperature value and specify its unit of measurement. It then performs the necessary calculations to convert the temperature to the other two units and displays the results.

Features:
Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin: Convert a given temperature in Celsius to both Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin: Convert a given temperature in Fahrenheit to both Celsius and Kelvin.
Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit: Convert a given temperature in Kelvin to both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
User Input Validation: Ensures that the temperature value provided is a numeric value and the unit is one of the accepted options (C, F, K).
